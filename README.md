## Features:
- Event Delegation on the container holding todos.
- If a todo is in edit mode, and removing the same todo from the list leads to change in Button text from 'Edit' ----> 'Add'.
- If a todo is in edit mode, and removing all the todos from the list leads to change in Button text from 'Edit' ----> 'Add', also input field is emptied.
- If clicked on 'Add' or 'Edit' with empty input field leads to toast notification asking to enter some input.
- Clicking on 'Add', adds a todo to the list.
- Clicking on 'Edit', edits that old todo, and updates it with the edit one.
